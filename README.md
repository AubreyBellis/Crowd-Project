Languages and frameworks used to create this app are HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery), Mongo DB, Mongoose, Express, and Node
#### To run the project:
• clone the repository and open file location in your terminal
• run: "npm install" in the terminal
• run:" npm run start:dev" in the terminal
• visit http://localhost:3000
## App Objective:
This app, titled 'Crowded' is designed to allow a user to view a list of places; Ponce City Market, Clermont Lounge, Victory, etc... The user can click on a particular place to view ratings and comments for the place; to make an informed decision on whether they want to patronize the place. They can also create a profile and comment themselves.

This app could also be utilized by businesses to review user's comments and ratings to improve their service. By maintaining an updated listing and high rating, a business could generate more business.
## Features:

* CRUD functionality for places, comments, and users.
* Seperate routes were created for each place. Users can view and create new comments/rating for each place. (No login function at the moment to store comments under users)
* Responsive site using media query - (WIP)
* Cloud based database deployed to Heroku
